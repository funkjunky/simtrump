	~~ bit of a game??? ~~\
\
	- make a talking donald trump bust\
		- first see about doubling the size of current image and see it in action\
		- make animation for new talking trump bust\
	- make the talking come over time, like an RPG, while talking bust\
	- choose font\
	- make everything more animated\'85 perhaps additional frames, or pumping text size or shadow\
		- highlight day of week and day number when i t changes, also highlight month when it changes, and year when it changes. Highlight quickly fades.\
\
	~~Game stylistically feels fun?~~\
\
	- questions shouldn\'92t have regions attached\'85 only attach them as they are \'91queued\'92 and crried on as they are \'91asked\'92\
	- answers should have the full info, including question asked with them.\
	- make spicer bust and kellyanne bust\
	- make prop images to go overtop of bust pictures, depending on subtype (podium, twitter)\
	- change depending on type\
\
	- fill in defaults, no more placeholder text\
		- default texts\
		- defaultresponses\
	- support multiple random messages\'85 especially for extraResponse (ie. Do Nothing)\
\
	- a lot more questions and answers, Should have a total of at least 12.\
	- if I have more than 12, then perhaps don\'92t queue answered questions, then when all questions are answers, the user wins!\
\
	- have scripted events\
		- small loan, whenever he got it\
		- asked if he\'92ll run for president\
		- he wins\
		- inauguration\
		- random\
		- after duration [less than using all the questions], declared winner!\
\
	- make some protestors\
	- add protests\
\
	- scoring??\

	- make wonky music\
